# Recommendations

We produce recommendation based on global best practices for a verity of topics related to development at ESDC.
This project is used to store the recommendations for the DevCoP separately from the [root project (esdc-devcop.github.io)](https://github.com/esdc-devcop/esdc-devcop.github.io) while still hosted under the same website.
See a [list of our recommendations](https://esdc-devcop.github.io/recommendations/).
