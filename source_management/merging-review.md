# Managing Merge Requests, Using Code Review

## Committing Code

Follow these simple steps:

1. Commit often. - _Whenever_ you change a piece of code that is testable and compiles.
1. Push your _working_ branch at the end of each "development session" (before walking away from your computer for lunch).
1. Request a PR/MR (with review) before having more than 100 lines changed.

## Code Review

Follow a few simple ideas:

- When approving a merge, you are just as responsible for the changes as the person who made them. So you should understand them just as well.
- Only review changed lines.
- Anyone on the project can raise concerns (blocking) on a PR/MR, even if they are not assigned to it.
- Can be blocked for any reason, including empty line spaces or too many changes in one PR/MR.
- The goal of a PR/MR should ultimately be knowledge transfer.
