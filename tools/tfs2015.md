# TFS 2015 Use and Configuration Recommendation

## Overview

This document provides guidelines to manage the projects in ESDC that hare hosted in SADE's instance of TFS 2015 to provide strong recommendations as to the implementation and use of the tool for these projects.
TFS 2015 offers two version control systems, TFVC and Git.

ESDC has developed a default template that is slightly different than the default provided by Microsoft in order to accommodate a few specific requirements from our Testing Services team.
It is the recommendation that this is the only template that is used and that no customization is made. Most projects in TFS currently have customization and should be actively working with SADE to remove all of it.

SADE (Shared Application Development Environment) is the technical owner of TFS 2015. Any questions or requests should be made though NSD assigned to 'NA-SADEADMIN'.

## TFS Settings

Additional details on **how to configure** your TFS environment can be found here: [English](http://architecture/sade-edap/admin/Shared%20Documents/TFS%202015%20Project/SRU%20Docs/USERGUIDE_R57072_TFS2015_Update4_E.docx) & [French](http://architecture/sade-edap/admin/Shared%20Documents/TFS%202015%20Project/SRU%20Docs/USERGUIDE_R57072_TFS2015_Update4_F.docx).
This document focus on the recommendations for those settings.

### Iterations

Iterations are a way to identify the cycle/release/milestone/sprint you are working on.
They are used to assign Work Items to the right time period and also as a filter to Queries and Reports.

Iteration names should reflect the version of the product being developed for that iteration.
The name should stay consistent across multiple iterations to aid with sorting.
The iterations could contain sub-iteration only if necessary for organizing "sprints" or "cycles".
All iterations should have a start and end date set.
The top level iteration, named the same as your TFS project, should be set as the backlog iteration (right click).
The current iteration should be selected with the checkbox on the left; this will change over time.
If you have sub iterations you may want to select multiple at a time.
These setting will effect your Kan-ban board and overall project planning so ensure you set it so your team can be successful.

### Areas

Areas are a way of grouping the structure of your system, components, modules.
They are used to assign Work Items to the proper artifact of your system and also as a filter in Queries and Reports.

The structure and naming should mimic the structure and naming of your source code structure.
They should never contain release information.
They should not have sections for "types" of bugs or work items; aka not Security, Performance, Web Accessibility, Testing.
The areas that are part of regular development (not R&D, or not Legacy) should be selected with the left checkbox; this will set Work Items in these area to show in the backlog.
Most teams will likely need to have everything selected.

### Security

This is where access to different levels of features can be set within TFS.
There are three separate groupings for how security is organized: Teams, TFS groups, Windows groups.
The permissions of the TFS groups should never be changed from the defaults.

Different Teams can be created for organizing your security; it is recommended that you have one team for each type of working member (Developers, Testers).
Adding a Windows group whenever possible over adding individual users is a much more maintainable method to maintaining access to the project (single point of change).
TFS groups should only have Teams and other TFS groups as their members (no Windows groups or user accounts).
The Windows groups section will populate if the group has been added to a Team; they can't be edited from TFS.
Teams may have other Teams as members.
You should have a default team with the TFS project name that should have members from the core teams.
Permissions should only be set at the TFS group level.

### Alerts

The suggested recommendation is to use the default alerts.
If the team requires additional alerts to stay effective they should enable custom alerts.

### Services

If you are using External Git for your Endpoint, you should use a Token rather than a user/password.

### Test

Defaults should be maintained.
